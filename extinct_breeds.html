    <h1>Extinct Dog breeds</h1> 
    <h2>This page will talk about dog breeds that used to exest but not anymore</h2>
    <h3>Extinct dogs of the pre-contact Americas</h3>
    <p>Before the europens arive in the americas, the Native Americas had dogs of their own. But unfortionly most of them are extinct.</p>
    <p>they're extinct because the europeans brought their own dogs, and those dogs had diseades that killed most of the dogs native to the Americas, and it's belived that europeans didn't like the native dogs and might of killed some of them. <br>it is belived that the diseases had killed pre-contad dogs on a far worse scale than the diseases that killed the native americans.</p>
    <p>here is a list of the pre-contact dogs that are now extinct</p>
    <p>Chiribaya Dog: their are no images of this dog</p>
    <p>Hare Indian Dog: no one knows if it was aculey a dog(it might have been part coyote) but it looks like one and sufferd the same fate</p>
    <p>Hawaiian Poi Dog: which was native to Hawaii but sufferd a simler fate to the rest</p>
    <p>Tahitian Dog</p>
    <p>Fuegian dog</p>
    <p>Tahltan Bear Dog: which was breed to fight bears</p>
    <p>Techichi: which is belived to be the ancestor of the Chihuahua</p>
    <p>wool dog: their fer was very simailer to wool</p>
    <p>peruvian shepard dog: which guarded llamas and alpacas</p>
    <p>Innu cannoe hunting dog: which would resheve shot fish</p>
