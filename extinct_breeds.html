   <h3>Extinct dogs of the pre-contact Americas</h3>
   <p>Before the europens arive in the americas, the Native Americas had dogs of their own. But unfortionly most of them are extinct.</p>
   <p>they're extinct because the europeans brought their own dogs, and those dogs had diseades that killed most of the dogs native to the Americas, and it's belived that europeans didn't like the native dogs and might of killed some of them. it is belived that the diseases had killed pre-contad dogs on a far worse scale than the diseases that killed the native americans.</p>
